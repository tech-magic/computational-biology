# ðŸ“ˆ Why Is the Biological Growth or Decline Model Aligned with _e_ ?

## 1. _e_ Arises Naturally in Continuous Growth or Decay
In biological systems, the rate of change is often **proportional to the current size** of the population or quantity.

This relationship is modeled using a differential equation:
dy / dt = k * y

Where:
- `y(t)` is the quantity at time `t`,
- `k` is the constant rate of growth (`k > 0`) or decay (`k < 0`).

The solution to this equation is:
y(t) = yâ‚€ * e ^ (k * t)

## 2. Compounding and the Limit Definition of _e_ .

The constant _e_ (approximately 2.718) arises from the limit:
lim (n â†’ âˆž) (1 + (1 / n)) ^ n = e

This models **continuous compounding**, where change occurs at every infinitesimally small interval.

Many biological processes â€” such as **cell division**, **bacterial growth**, and **radioactive decay** â€” follow this pattern of continuous change.

## 3. Natural Exponential Behavior
The exponential function `e ^ (k * t)` captures **smooth, continuous, and proportional change** over time.

It is the most natural mathematical representation for systems where the **rate of change depends on the current state**.
