# THEORY:
# Gibbs Sampling is a stochastic algorithm for motif discovery. It improves motifs iteratively:
# - Randomly select a k-mer (motif) from each DNA sequence.
# - In each iteration:
#   1. Randomly remove one motif from the set.
#   2. Use the remaining motifs to build a profile matrix.
#   3. Sample a new motif from the excluded sequence using the profile matrix.
# - This process repeats for N iterations.
# - The goal is to converge to a set of motifs that are very similar (low total distance).
