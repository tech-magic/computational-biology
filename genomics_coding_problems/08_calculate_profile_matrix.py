# The profile matrix is a 4 x k matrix (where k is motif length) representing the frequency or probability
# of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) at every position in a collection of motifs.
# It is used to identify the most conserved positions in a set of sequences.
#
# ------------------
# A Simple Example
# ------------------
# 1. Input: A set of motifs
# All motifs should be the same length. 
# Example:
# Let's consider below list as the input Motifs:
#   ATCCGA
#   ACCCGA
#   ATTCGA
#   ATCCGA
#   ATTCGA
#
# Motif length: 6
# Number of motifs: 5
#
# 2. Initialize a 4 x k matrix
# Where k is the length of each motif (6 in this case), and the rows correspond to nucleotides A, C, G, T.
# You can start with a count matrix (optionally with pseudocounts, e.g., add 1 to each count to avoid zero probabilities).

# 3. Count nucleotides at each position
# Go column by column and count how many times each base appears.
# For the example above:

# Position	A	C	G	T
# 1	        5	0	0	0
# 2	        0	0	0	5
# 3	        0	0	0	5
# 4	        0	5	0	0
# 5	        0	0	5	0
# 6	        5	0	0	0

# So the Count Matrix:
# A: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
# C: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
# G: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
# T: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

# 4. Convert to a Profile Matrix (optional step)
# Divide each count by the number of sequences (e.g., 5) to get the probabilities at each position.
# So the Profile Matrix becomes:
# A: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
# C: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
# G: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
# T: [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# ðŸ§  Pro Tips
# Pseudocounts: Add 1 to each count to avoid 0 in probabilities (important for log-likelihood calculations).
