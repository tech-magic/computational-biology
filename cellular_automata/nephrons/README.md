# Nephron Simulation Program

## Overview

This program simulates the functioning of the nephron, which is the functional unit of the kidney. The nephron is responsible for filtering blood, reabsorbing necessary substances like water, sodium, and glucose, and excreting waste as urine. This simulation models the different stages of fluid processing as it moves through the nephron, influenced by biological factors like hydration, glucose levels, and hormones such as aldosterone and ADH.

The simulation uses a **Cellular Automaton** (CA) model, where each cell represents a section of the nephron. The cells change their state over time based on the physiological parameters in the body.

## Background Theory

### The Nephron
The nephron is the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney, and it plays a crucial role in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. The nephron consists of several parts, including the **glomerulus**, **proximal tubule**, **loop of Henle**, **distal tubule**, and **collecting duct**. As blood flows through these structures, substances like water, glucose, and sodium are filtered and reabsorbed, while waste products like urea are excreted as urine.

### Key Factors in the Simulation

- **Hydration Level**: Determines how much water is reabsorbed by the nephron.
- **Waste Concentration**: The amount of waste (e.g., urea) that needs to be excreted.
- **Glucose Level**: The amount of glucose in the blood. High glucose levels may cause more glucose to be filtered into the nephron.
- **Aldosterone Level**: A hormone that promotes sodium reabsorption in the nephron.
- **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone) Level**: Regulates water reabsorption in the nephron. Higher ADH levels result in more water being reabsorbed.

### Cellular Automaton Model
A **Cellular Automaton** is a computational model where each cell in a grid can change its state based on its neighbors and some rules. In this program, each cell represents a segment of the nephron, and it can be in one of the following states:
- **Filtered (0)**: Fluid has entered the nephron.
- **Reabsorbed (1)**: Fluid has been reabsorbed into the blood.
- **Excreted (2)**: Fluid is excreted as urine.

The cells' state changes based on the physiological factors mentioned above.

## What the Program Does

The program simulates the process of filtration, reabsorption, and excretion that occurs in the nephron over a series of **timesteps**. At each timestep:
- The parameters (hydration, waste, glucose, aldosterone, and ADH) fluctuate over time to simulate changes in the body.
- Each cell updates its state based on the current conditions and its neighbors, representing the dynamic process occurring within the nephron.
- The simulation runs for 100 timesteps and produces an animation showing how the nephron processes fluid through its various sections.

The simulation results are displayed in a **visual animation** that shows how fluid moves through the nephron, changes its state (filtered, reabsorbed, excreted), and how different biological factors influence this process.

## How to Run the Program

To run the program on your machine, follow these steps:

### Requirements

1. **Python 3.x**: This program requires Python 3 or later to run.
2. **Python Libraries**: You need to install the following Python libraries:
   - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
   - `matplotlib`: For plotting and animation.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Program

1. Save the program in a file, e.g., nephron_simulation.py.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the program.
4. Run the program using Python:

```bash
python nephron_simulation.py
```

The program will run, and a window will open showing the animation of the nephron simulation. The animation will update the state of the nephron cells over time, based on the fluctuating biological factors.

### Visualization
The animation shows the state of the nephron grid. Each cell represents a section of the nephron and will be colored according to its state:
- Filtered: Represented in one color.
- Reabsorbed: Represented in another color.
- Excreted: Represented in a third color.

You will see how the state of the nephron cells changes over time as the simulation progresses.

### Conclusion

This program is a simplified model of how the nephron works in the human body, influenced by hydration, glucose, waste levels, and hormones. The simulation provides a visual representation of the biological processes that help the body maintain balance and dispose of waste.
