## 📚 1. Background (see folder `/background`)

This section provides theoretical foundations and algorithmic guides for understanding computational biology.

### Files:
- `cellular_automata_basics.md`  
  Intro to basic concepts of cellular automata for computational applications.

- `computational_biology_basic_concepts.md`  
  Intro to molecular biology concepts for computational applications.

- `computational_biology_io_file_formats.md`  
  Overview of key bioinformatics file formats like FASTA, FASTQ, VCF, etc.

- `profile_matrix_and_motif_search_algorithms.md`  
  Detailed explanation of motif search strategies (used in `genomics_coding_problems`).

---

## 🧬 2. Genomics Coding Problems (see folder `/genomics_coding_problems`)

Python scripts solving practical problems in genomics. Ideal for hands-on practice, assignments, or interviews.

### Topics Include:
- Motif finding, profile matrix, consensus sequence
- Hamming distance, reverse complements
- Randomized, Greedy, Gibbs Sampling, EM motif search

### Quick Start:
```bash
cd genomics_coding_problems
python 01_count_motif_occurances.py
```

Each file is self-contained and documented.

- `automaton.py` — Core CA logic
- `data/*.csv` — Omics datasets
- `README.md` — Documentation

#### 🧫 `nephrons/`
Simulates nephron behavior using CA.
- `simulating_nephrons.py`
- `README.md`

#### 🌿 `personalized_ayurveda/`
Models Ayurvedic medicine personalization with CA logic.
- `ayurvedic_ca.py`
- `README.md`

## ⚙️ 4. Cellular Automata with Agentic AI (see folder `/agentic_cellular_automata`)
Core logic and experiments to combine intelligent AI agent behaviors with cellular automata models leading to realistic biological behaviour by leveraging `emergence`.

---

## 🧩 5. Biology versus the Exponential Constant (see folder `/biology_with_e`)
An insightful discussion on why every biological system has a tightly coupled relationship with e (the exponential component).

---

## 🎯 6. Discovering Dino DNA (see folder `/collaborative_filtering`)
An attempt to discover missing dinosaur DNA sequences by cross-application of collaborative filtering (inspired by recommender systems) to genomics.

---

## 🧬 7. Relational DB Schema for Genomics (see folder `/genomics_database`)
An attempt to implement a relational DB schema for storing, retrieving, and managing genomics-related datasets.

---

## 💥 8. Personalized Metabolomics (see folder `/metabolomics_database`)
An attempt to implement a personalized metabolomics DB schema with Ayurvedic concepts for:
  - storing, retrieving, and managing metabolomics-related datasets
  - calculating the personalized Ayurvedic profile of each individual over time 

---

## 🔮 9. Quantum Neuron (see folder `/quantum_neuron`)
An attempt to implement a quantum neuron (by leveraging core concepts of quantum computing) to simulate the actual behaviour of a biological neuron (more realistic than the standard Turing neuron used in ANNs).
