# üß¨ Bioinformatics Algorithms in Python

This repository contains a curated collection of Python programs solving classic problems in **bioinformatics**, with a focus on **DNA sequence analysis**, **motif discovery**, **profile matrix computation**, and **protein translation**.

Each script in this collection builds towards solving more complex tasks using foundational algorithmic techniques commonly taught in computational biology and bioinformatics courses.

## üìå Learning Focus

These implementations are designed for learning and are structured to reflect the algorithmic logic behind bioinformatics problems rather than optimized production code. Great for:

- Students of **bioinformatics** or **computational biology**
- Coders solving **Bioinformatics Stronghold** problems
- Researchers prototyping **motif discovery pipelines**
